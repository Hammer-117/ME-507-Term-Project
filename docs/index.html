Introduction</h1>
<p>This is the main documentation page for my project. It provides an overview of the project and its components.</p>

Mechanical Design</h1>
<p>The robot, shown below, incorporates a large variety of sensors, two drive wheels, and a pair of collector wheels. The two collector wheels are driven by a single motor and the are connected with gears at the top of the robot. These wheels are 3D printed out of TPU, and since they were more slippery than we intended, we used rubber bands to increase friction with the ping pong balls. The collector wheels drive the balls into a vertical storage tube.</p>

<p>All of the blue parts are 3D printed out of PLA and the base plate is made out of laser-cut acrylic. All of the parts that interact directly with the motor shaft were designed to be a press-fit, which caused a few problems with the drive wheels. The motor shaft was quite short and the motor mounts needed to be thick to support the load of the robot, leaving a very small amount of motor shaft for the press fit on the wheel. This led to the wheels falling off quite often. In the future, I plan to use a better style of hub when interacting with the motor shaft.</p>
<p>The gears were attached to the shafts with a "set screw" that went through the whole shaft more like a pin. This held them very securely and eliminated most problems with screwing into a 3D printed part.</p>
<p>The battery case used a 3D printed bottom half with a laser cut acrylic top cover. The cover attaches to the bottom with a screw on one side and a tab and slot design on the other for easier assembly and disassembly.</p>

Electrical Design</h1>
<p>The storage tube has an integrated color sensor to confirm that we have the correct color ball. Because this color sensor requires a large amount of light, we also included a very bright LED to light up the ball and get a more accurate reading.</p>
<p>We also have line sensors mounted to the front of the robot. This was going to be for navigation before we planned on using the "eye in the sky", but we decided to keep them as a redundant check of the camera system.</p>
<p>Another sensor we used is an IMU to get a sense of the direction of the robot. For a better sense of the location of the robot, each of the motors have encoders.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, another sensor that we use is the "eye in the sky" that Nathan's team developed. To interact with this system, we wrote a bit of python code that would pull the data and send it to the robot, using an pair of arduinos as intermediaries. </p>
